Here are some great ways to help fill out your family tree. <br data-v-a0faec2d> Genealogy is a great hobby, and one that can occupy you for years or decades. But it can all start to feel a bit ‘samey’ after a while. If you’ve gotten into a rut with your family tree explorations, consider any of the following as a way to ‘blow out the cobwebs’ and approach your genealogy from a different direction. <br data-v-a0faec2d> Do some work on that book of family history Names and dates are one thing, but anyone who has delved into their family’s past will also have heard some interesting stories. Write one or two of them down. Who knows – you might end up with something publishable. If not, it would still make a worthy ‘vanity press’ book you can give to relatives. Gifts based on a shared family history make incredibly meaningful and personal presents. In a world of gift certificates and mass produced plastic garbage, make something no one else could for someone who will really appreciate it. <br data-v-a0faec2d> Sort out (and label) all your family photos Maybe you’ve been putting this, or something like it, off for too long already. Organise your photos, mementos, or other bits of family history. And make sure to write a few things down about each of those photos or items. After all, you might know why Uncle Zeke was holding a broken model airplane in that photo, but will your grandchildren, if you aren’t around to ask? Do your bit for future family historians. <br data-v-a0faec2d> Make time to see some old or distant relatives, and write down their family stories. Just imagine how many family stories have already been lost to time. Get out here and record a few. Encourage them to spill the beans about the really juicy stories. Heck, make sure to ask about the scandals. Those make the most interesting reading generations down the road, when no one is left to be embarrassed. <br data-v-a0faec2d> Is anyone else in your family or friend group working on a genealogy? Help them with theirs. If your family history is beginning to feel a little stale, why not lend your expertise (and resources) to someone else’s work? Seeing someone else’s enthusiasm for the subject many be all the boost you need. Also, you never know when you might need a hand too. <br data-v-a0faec2d> Pick up a new genealogy book Genealogy and family tree research has become very popular in the last few years. There are new books being written all the time, and some of them have very innovative ideas. At the worst, you could learn something new. At the best, you could find a renewed interest in one of your pet passions. No one ever regretted reading a good book. <br data-v-a0faec2d> See if there are any genealogy conferences or seminars in your area coming up These can be great opportunities to learn new techniques and see some of the products and services on the market for both amateur and professional genealogists. Many even give away free samples or trials. <br data-v-a0faec2d> Take a mini vacation organised around genealogy Is there a place associated with your family, or a set of isolated records you’ve always wanted to see? Take a few days, and make a vacation out of it. At the very least, a change of scenery does most people good! </div></div></div></div>',1),L={class:"px-5 footer"},Y={class:"container"},j={class:"footer-cta columns is-gapless mb-0 pb-6"},E=a(()=>e("div",{class:"column is-7"},[e("h1",{class:"is-size-2 has-text-primary has-text-weight-bold mb-3"},"Start Your Free Tree Now!"),e("div",{class:"is-size-6 has-text-white has-text-weight-regular"}," Your first tree is 100% free!
