Genealogists and family history researchers often discover uncomfortable truths about their own family, and often there are several people still alive who would feel strongly – one way or another – about those secrets becoming widely known. How do you handle such a situation? Professional genealogists and historians, of course, have established Codes of Conduct they are expected to follow, and already know the way they are supposed to handle these issues. Amateur historians and family tree researchers, though, rarely have that training. Nor do they have the support of a formal ‘code of conduct’ to fall back on. Every extended family seems to have a ‘lorekeeper’. Someone who knows all the stories, the truth behind all the sordid secrets and where the bodies are buried – sometimes literally. A great aunt perhaps. Someone who knows precisely who had affairs with who going back to the last war, and can make some very educated observations about which birth certificates are not 100% accurate. Finding and gaining the trust of such a lorekeeper can lead to amazing breakthroughs when it comes to family history – as well as learning a few secrets you might wish you never knew about. Once that happens, what are your responsibilities – to yourself, to your family, and to the truth in the abstract? One of the most common circumstances you might find is the ‘secret first marriage’. It might have been ‘quietly observed’ during a couple’s life that one (or even both) of them had previously been married, but for cultural or personal reasons, this wasn’t spoken of. A secret like that can easily fall out of living memory… until someone goes digging through marriage records in the town. Something like that, by itself, might not even be an issue today. But what if the earlier union had offspring? What if there is an entire line of cousins that had not previously been acknowledged, or even known about? What if the first marriage was never officially ended? There are people living today who could be scandalised to find out their parent’s or grandparent’s marriage wasn’t 100% above-board and proper. Do you make this information part of the ‘official’ family tree you are putting together, or do you maintain the fiction? Being open about what you’ve discovered could see entire branches of your family tree never speaking to you again (this is an extreme example, but it has happened). Hiding the fact could deny an important fact from dozens or hundreds of people who would prefer to know the truth. Another level of ethical concern comes from the possibility of publishing your results online. Sharing the story of Great-Gran-Edna’s-Secret-First-Son-Who-was-Raised-By-Her-Sister among your relatives in a quiet, controlled fashion is one thing. You’re one of the ‘lorekeepers’ now. There is precedent. But how would people feel if you made that ‘revised’ family tree public? Pearls, even today, might be clutched. You can always stop telling a story if you change your mind about the ethics of it. You can even deny ever telling it that way. But once something is online, it is effectively ‘forever’. You can’t control where it goes. Alas, there is no easy choice. Some people feel you should consider ‘what the deceased would have wanted’. Others consider the feelings of their living relatives the most important factor. Others feel the truth deserves to be told, regardless of consequences. We can’t tell you how to decide. But we can prepare you for the possibility. You’ve been warned.
