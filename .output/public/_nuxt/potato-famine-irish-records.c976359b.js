The Great Hunger (Gorta Mór) was only the largest and most memorable of the devastating natural and man-made disasters ravaging Ireland in the last 1000 years. Many, many things make it difficult to trace one’s ancestry much farther back than emigration from Ireland. The Republic of Ireland gained its independence from the UK in 1922, by splitting from Northern Ireland, which chose to remain. However, that was just the finishing trauma for a country that had been colonised for almost 1000 years at that point. Since the first millennium BCE, the Emerald Isle has been subject to religious and cultural repression, economic colonialism and literal bloody conquest. This made regular, contiguous record keeping nearly impossible for long periods. That said, the Great Hunger was truly devastating, even against that backdrop of repression. A history of the famine would have to start in the late 1500s, when potatoes were first introduced to Ireland from the New World colonies. Before that, the agricultural economy of the Irish people was more inclined to fishing and livestock ranching – and ranching takes an immense amount of land to support a small population. As more and more land was taken from the native Irish farmers and operated as commercial English enterprises in the years leading up to the Great Hunger, traditional forms of agriculture had to be abandoned – the native population simply did not have enough and to maintain their numbers. Starvation was common, and the social structure that had been a part of their culture for more than a millennium had essentially collapsed. The remaining Irish farmers often had no choice but to turn to potato farming in order to feed themselves and the rest of the native population – nothing else could produce enough calories to keep them alive on the scraps and they were allowed to use. Of course, this was a poor kind of survival – potatoes are starchy and full of calories, but low in many nutrients the body needs. Once potato farming had gained a foothold, growers of other crops were unable to compete with the abundance of potatoes, which really did grow well in Ireland’s soil and climate. Soon the majority of arable land in Irish control – as well as much of that owned by English colonists, still mostly worked by Irish farmers – was growing potatoes. This led to a sharp increase in the Irish population – and the literal impossibility of supporting that population with anything other than potato agriculture. Then in 1844, a fungus called Potato Blight found its way from Mexico (where there was enough genetic variance in potato crops to resist it) to Europe. Potato crops failed in many places, but this was most disastrous in Ireland. There, few other crops were being grown in huge swathes of the country. Worse, there was practically zero variance in the species and lineage of the potatoes grown. It was a classic monoculture, and it led to apocalyptic crop failures. Potato production did not recover for many years. As tenant farmers lost the ability to pay for their farms, more and more land was taken over by English colonists. The starving and homeless emigrated in huge, disorganised masses. That is why family records so often start being kept with the generation that emigrated from Ireland. Record keeping was a very low priority during a famine and social support disaster that saw more than a million deaths over just a few years.
