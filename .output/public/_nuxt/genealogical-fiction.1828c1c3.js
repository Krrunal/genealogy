It should come as no surprise that people who are interested in genealogy and exploring their own family tree tend to be readers by inclination, and there is a substantial field of genealogically-themed or genealogically-related novels out there. But some writers are turning to their own genealogical research as inspiration for their fiction. We could fill a whole blog with profiles of genealogical fiction authors, but that has already been done to death. Most of these tend to the mystery or crime genres, with plots involving genealogists struggling to uncover ancient family mysteries before it is, somehow or another, ‘too late’. One would think it would be hard to contrive ways a 300-year-old secret heir or a stolen inheritance could motivate living people to murder or other skulduggery, but by the sheer volume of work being published today it seems like the well never runs dry. But there is another sub-genre entirely, and it is one filled with possibilities for those of us who like to dig into the stories of our ancestors and uncover the secrets and scandals that lie just beneath the surface. Consider to the works of authors like Joy Stonehouse, who delve into their own family histories for inspiration. Now, you aren’t expected to discover that your ancestress stole a prince’s heart as well as his cursed blue diamond and ran, laughing, into the night. I mean, if you do, write that book! But 99.999% of the time, the stories and scandals you uncover will be much less James Bond and more Downton Abbey – or Coronation Street, depending on how posh your ancestors actually were. Well, so far as we know, Ms Stonehouse’s ancestors didn’t steal any cursed jewels, or uncover any secret devil cults blackmailing the crown, or anything even remotely as exciting as all that. But that doesn’t stop her, and it shouldn’t stop you! Indeed, in books like Witch-bottles and Windlestraws, Stonehouse tells stories inspired (sometimes very) loosely by the early 18th century family histories and legends she’s uncovered by shaking her own family tree. For example, in Witch-bottles, the historical family of the author in the historical village of Reighton live out only slightly un-historical lives in a time where a bad harvest still meant starvation, and turning to the supernatural – whether the church or witchcraft – was seen as the only real option. These same themes – weather, religion, witchcraft and good-old-fashioned family drama – play out in the sequels, New Arrivals in Reighton and Whisper to the Bees. The beauty of this approach – setting aside for the moment the talent and skill of the writer – is that the setting and the characters are all given incredible depth and verisimilitude by being… well… real. Many genealogists make up profiles of their ancestors, in order to better understand them, their relationships, and the time they lived in. This is precisely the kind of deep, flawed and incredibly believable character building that a really good novel demands. You may find that, while recording your family history, you’ve also written 90% of an amazing demi-historical novel. But don’t give up on your great-grandmother the jewel thief. We’d read that.
