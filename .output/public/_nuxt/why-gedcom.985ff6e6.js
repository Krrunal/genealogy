Computerised genealogy is a relatively new thing. Before the 1990s, all genealogical research was done the old-fashioned way – interviews with surviving relatives, crawling through dusty stacks of birth and marriage records, and reading ancient newspaper articles on microfiche. When the first computerised genealogy solutions came around nearly 30 years ago, they changed everything. That is not to say that everything has already been digitised. Plenty of those dusty old records still sit, virtually untouched, in county records archives, newspaper morgues and libraries all over the world. Many of them have never been even partially digitised. But many have been scanned and uploaded, and can be accessed easily. In fact, many genealogists use a standard file format called GEDCOM (the GEnealogical Data COMmunication standard), which has become the industry standard for cross-platform genealogical communication over the years. The GEDCOM format allows historians, genealogists and record-keepers of all kinds to exchange information and whole family trees easily. "),e("br"),a(" Why does this matter to you? There are two main reasons. All of this genealogical sharing means your family history research might be much, much easier. You see, most historians and genealogists aren’t selfish with their data. They have a passion for making history and especially family history open and discoverable, and most would love to share al of the research they have with you in hopes that it will help you discover your family tree and that you might have just a few scraps of new information on some of the names on their huge lists. "),e("br"),a(" You could actually be helping advance history, statistical science and realms of research that haven’t been invented yet The sad truth is that the vast majority of the people who have ever lived have not had their names recorded or passed on to the present. Of course, this is the case for anyone who died before writing. However, the last thousand years or so saw birth, marriage and death information written down for most people in many parts of the world – and yet almost all of this information has been lost forever. Most of that information is lost, because unless it is lucky enough to find its way into a protected archive of some kind, it was held on to only as long as people felt a personal connection to the subjects of the data. When the entire village is starving in a bad year in the 1400s, preserving records of your great aunt’s father-in-law’s ancestors was not a high priority. That said, a few snippets of genealogical data have been handed down through families for centuries. And any of these records could add the ‘missing link’ some researcher needs to make a conclusion or connection in their studies. Digitising and sharing your family tree could make a truly important contribution to science. However, it is a lot more likely to benefit you, but filling in branches of that family tree that you didn’t even know existed.
