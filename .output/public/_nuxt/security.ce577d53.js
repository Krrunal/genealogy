"),e("br"),s(" Well, let’s consider a case of another website in the industry, who will remain nameless here. Though you could probably figure out who it was if you looked. "),e("br"),s(" Just over 2 years ago, a website with nearly 1½ million people’s genetic information on it was breached – but in an unusual way. In this case it was less about stealing the company’s data or even the credit card numbers of their users, but about getting the actual DNA data of the users. The breach itself was actually detected quickly, and the vulnerability the hackers used was patched – but all of the DNA data was ‘out there’ in ‘the wrong hands’. Now, what could cyber criminals do with DNA data? This isn’t a sci-fi spy movie. They weren’t about to fake some important user’s DNA to gain entry into their secret lair or steal their tricked-out helicopter. Instead, the hackers (or someone who bought the data from them – who can say – posted thousands of fake profiles on the original website, once it was up and running. These profiles displayed false DNA results that suggested they were long lost relatives of existing users – exactly what many users hoped to find. Well, the worst part is we can’t be sure what was done with what they learned from the process. They could have pretended to be relatives, and scammed people out of money and support, but no one has reported anyone trying, and all the fake profiles were spotted. It could have been something as sinister as an insurance company, posting DNA results known to have a vulnerability to a disease like Alzheimer’s, and seeing how many people matched – they could then drop any customers they then felt might be a bad risk for an expensive illness. It could even have been law enforcement, using the hack to search for DNA that matches that from a crime scene, even against website users who chose not to allow law enforcement to access their results – something they have every right to refuse. In the end, the digital world has dangers we can’t even imagine. Our data can be used for nefarious purposes we might not ever actually now about. That is why Family Tree 365 uses literally top of the line security procedures with all of the sensitive data we hold, and why we don’t hold on to any user data longer than we need to in order to serve the purposes of our customers. You deserve the best, an we deliver it.
