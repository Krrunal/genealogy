Now, strictly speaking, we all probably have the same size family tree, either going back to Adam and Eve, an ancestor in central Africa, or someone neither the theologians or scientists can guess about. But that’s not what we mean. We mean, who had the longest prepared family tree ever? How many generations were they able to go back? Well, according to some sources, an ancient Chinese philosopher and politician named 孔夫子 wins the honours. That’s pronounced ‘Kǒng Fūzǐ’ by the way, and means ‘Master Kong’. You probably know him as ‘Confucious’. A genealogy of his family goes back a staggering 86 generations, spanning some 2,500 years! Of course, Master Kong was very important in life, and had the motive, means and opportunity to have his own genealogy charted out in detail. However, even he (or his servants) couldn’t see 2000 years back in time. If they had somehow been able to, that would reach back to before even China had a written language. No one recorded ancestry that far back. But Master Kong continued to be a celebrated personality long after his death, with his writings remaining influential in philosophy and politics to this day. Having ‘the Confucius’ as an ancestor is almost as prestigious today as it was in 400 BCE… even though some 3 million people all over the world claim descent from the great man today. In fact, that claim to ancestral fame has never ceased to be important, and 2,500 years later, an organisation called the CGCC or Confucius Genealogy Compilation Committee exists to serve the needs of this 3 million-strong demographic. They have recently published the 5th volume of the official ‘Confucius Genealogy’. "),e("br"),a(" How big is a 2,500-year genealogy? Really big. It has 2 million plus verified, official names. The entire thing is an 80-volume set. A hard copy is probably fairly pricey. Earlier editions were slimmer, but still remarkably detailed. The first fully recognised, officially accepted Genealogy of old Master Kong was published some 1500 years after his time, in the year 1080. Over the next thousand years, 4 more editions were made. The 4th, in 1937, had only (only!) 600,000 names. "),e("br"),a(" So what is new in the 5th edition? Well, a lot has changed since 1937, and not just in China. The 5th edition is the first to include Master Kong’s female descendants, those who are minority ethnicities (China has more of those than you think) and those living overseas. In all, this added more than 1,300,000 names to the list. "),e("br"),a(" How reliable is it? Reasonably. There was zero DNA testing done, but its not like there was any problem with records. If you can prove you were related to someone who was already ‘known’ to be related to the great man (and paid around half a pound), you could be added to the list. As the entry fees alone come to a cool £1,000,000, and no mention of how many 80-volume sets they actually sold, the publishers don’t really have any motive to exclude families from the ‘Confucius Club’, do they?
