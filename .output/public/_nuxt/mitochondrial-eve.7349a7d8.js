Science says yes, and she’s more recent than we might think. "),e("br"),a(" Mitochondrial Eve is not a forgotten medieval holiday. It is a person – at least theoretically. Humanity has been around in one form or another for millions of years. Just how ‘humanity’ is defined varies from science to science and even from person to person. Homo habilis – a species of early humans – first appears in the fossil record around 2 million years ago. Soon after, Homo erectus emerged, arguably the first people to tame fire. But some people wouldn’t call them ‘fully human’. Homo sapiens and Homo neanderthalensis appeared independently some time between 200,000 and 300,000 years ago. Together, these groups interbred to become modern humans. By 40,000 years ago or so, the only ‘hominids’ remaining were thoroughly modern humans – Homo sapiens sapiens. So our OLDEST living ancestor was millions of years ago. Bet we also had a MOST RECENT common ancestor. Some time, long after the genus Homo had developed, some person happened to have children who became ancestors to everyone currently alive. Science has even found a way to tell who that might have been. Most of us know how DNA works, and what DNA tracing can do for the field of genealogy. However, we all have several kinds of DNA. The kind we most often think about is ‘nuclear DNA’, the DNA of the cell’s nucleus. All the ‘chromosomes’ and ‘genes’ we hear about are part of the nuclear DNA. But human cells are complex little beasts, and they have organelles in them besides the nucleus. One other type of organelle is called the mitochondrion. Mitochondria have their own, completely separate DNA. Why? Because they aren’t strictly human. They’re more like parasites that have been part of us for so long we could not live without them, nor they without us. But mitochondria were once simple bacteria, and they have simple bacterial DNA. We get all of our mitochondria from our mothers – they hitch a ride in the egg, and reproduce to be a part of every cell we’ll ever have. Because they reproduce asexually – dividing as bacteria do – their DNA changes very slowly indeed. So slowly that scientists can track every little mutation, and tell from that how long ago it must have been since all of our mitochondria were identical descendants of those in a single human being – Mitochondrial Eve. According to the egg-heads, it happened 155,000 years ago – after Homo sapiens evolved, but before any of us had migrated out of Africa. So, if the scientists are right, and if we could magically get records from before writing was invented, all of our family trees would link up around 10,000 generations in the past. However, they would all go back farther than that, as well. ‘Mitochondrial Eve’ is just a name. She isn’t the ‘Biblical Eve’, and she certainly wasn’t the first human female. There were tens of thousands of people in the world back then, perhaps more. She just happens to be one of the ancestors of every human living today – and therefore of every human who will ever live going forward. Still, maybe it will help us feel some solidarity in a time when people seem so eager to fight over differences.
