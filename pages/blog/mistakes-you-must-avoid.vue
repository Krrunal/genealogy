								3 Mistakes Every Beginning Genealogist Should Try to Avoid Mistakes are part of the learning process, and no amount of advice can prevent you from ever making a single mistake. However, there are 3 things
								almost every amateur genealogist seems to do early on that you can easily avoid – failing to profile your ancestors, conflating 2 people with the same name, and assigning fathers to children they could not,
								logically, have fathered. Let’s look at each of these in turn.
								<br />
								Failing to Profile In this sense, profiling means learning what kind of person someone really is, regardless of appearances, but from a distance. In this case, it is a distance of time and medium – you are
								learning about them solely through records and text. Why profile? Simply put, people misrepresent themselves in official records. Maybe someone had several income streams, or several careers throughout their
								life. They almost certainly listed the most prestigious as their ‘profession’. When it comes to marriage and children issues, the motivations to ‘fudge’ the records now and then become even more obvious.
								Failing to catch any of these ‘fibs’ could lead your research in the wring direction. Make a profile, as detailed as you can, for each relative you investigate. Write it down and store it away.
								<br />
								Same name, different people This is incredibly common, and it is all too easy to miss. If two cousins of the same generation are given the same unusual family name, it can be incredibly easy to create one
								imaginary hybrid person out of them. After you make a mistake like that, nothing in the family tree fits quite right. We mention cousins specifically, because this can be the hardest pairing to sort out. If a
								grandfather and grandson have the same name, the dates will be way off. It isn’t impossible that the old guy took a new, young wife at the age of 85… but a new wife in a completely different village? And then
								had 5 kids? Dying at the ripe old age of 130? You can tell there is a problem. But if there happen to be a pair of Sarah Milligans, born in the same hospital, both to a mother named Mary, having children at
								roughly the same time… You can easily conflate them into a single woman with a complicated love life.
								<br />
								The Impossible Father We say ‘impossible father’ because, traditionally, there has been very little possibility of mistaking maternity – except in the cases where records have been deliberately mis-stated, as
								above. Simply put, do the math every time you assign a child to a pair of parents. If the putative father was a 6 year old boy or had been dead more than 9 months at the time of the birth, you got something
								wrong. The parents also have to have, conceivably (pun intended), been in the same place at the same time at least briefly. That said, some people and families have had a very lax attitude to recording exact
								birth dates. If you notice an ‘impossible father’ date, do not throw the possible relationship out. Put on your investigating hat, and get to the bottom of the mystery.
								<br />
								There. Now you can avoid these three mistakes. You’ll make other, more sophisticated mistakes instead!
