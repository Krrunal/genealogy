								When it’s time to start over What could drive you to begin your genealogy again from scratch? This will seem like a very alarming idea to some of us. If you just got started in the hobby a few weeks or months
								ago, you probably didn’t experience a pang if dread at the idea of scrapping all of your work and starting over with a slightly different approach, or with new sources of data. However, some of us have put
								years or even decades into our family tree research. Some of us have filled while volumes with names, dates and anecdotes about our ancestors. Some of us have published books! What might possess a genealogist
								in that position to just… start over? It’s not as radical an idea as it sounds, however. Here are two reasons why it might not even sound crazy:
								<br />
								New materials, methodologies or evidence has become available DNA evidence was an absolute game changer in the genealogy world. If you started your family tree research before this was available, or before it
								was cheaply and easily available, it might not be a bad idea to go back to the beginning and make sure your entire structure isn’t built on a shake foundation. That said, you don’t necessarily need to scrap
								all of your previous work. There is every chance that your DNA evidence will confirm what your other research has shown. In that case, any new DNA based discoveries can supplement your existing work, not
								replace it. On the other hand – what if the DNA doesn’t match? What if, say, Great Grandpa Melvin, the patriarch of your current extended family, isn’t genetically related to any of the other children of his
								parents? Does that really negate all that family history? Lots of people were adopted secretly. Lots of half-siblings were full, real parts of the family. Lots of genetically unrelated people really were
								family. Don’t obsess over DNA. There is more to family (and family history) that biology. Just note ‘probably adopted, relationship confirmed’ or the equivalent.
								<br />
								Your skills have levelled up since you began your genealogy Let’s say you started your family tree research 15 years ago. You’re probably dramatically more skilled at research, at citation, and at drawing
								valid conclusions from your sources than you were when you started. Looking back at the base of that family tree might seem… embarrassing. You can do better. You’re doing better as we speak! So why not go
								back and re-do the beginning? There are two likely outcomes, and they are both positive: You do the first few generations over, only better, and you confirm that you didn’t make any fundamental errors. You
								feel more confident, and your work looks that much better to an external analysis. You discover a basic, glaring error that compromises some of your later work. This will be emotionally devastating, we’re not
								gonna lie. But… you can fix it, and do it right. And going forward, you have the same confidence you had before that everything is correct – only you’re not wrong this time. That has to be better than waiting
								another year or two to check, and having to scrap that much more work.
								<br />
								So don’t be afraid to re-evaluate your earlier work. It is always better to know for sure.
